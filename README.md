**'RCeize (Currently Learning Programming)'**

I'm currently in the tip of the iceberg if it's about programming, but I somehow know the fundamentals of front-end programming and that is HTML, CSS, Javascript, and that is I currently know in using front-end programming. As for back-end programming, the only thing that I know is python. Thank you for visiting my Profile. [RCeize] [RovilloCeazarGurrea].
